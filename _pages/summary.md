I am a permanent researcher at [INRAE](http://www.inrae.fr) (France) working on control theory and applications to life sciences. I resort to theoretical and numerical optimal control approaches to predict biological phenomena—such as regulatory mechanisms in bacterial cells—and to develop synthetic control strategies for industrial and biotechnological applications.

I obtained my Automation and Control Systems Engineering degree at the [National University of Quilmes](https://www.unq.edu.ar/) (Buenos Aires, Argentina) in 2015. In 2017, I moved to France where I obtained my Master’s degree in Systems, Control & IT specialized in Control and Systems Theory at the [Université Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/) (Grenoble, France). By the end of 2021, I obtained my Ph.D. in Automation, Signal and Image Processing at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) center at [Université Côte d’Azur](https://univ-cotedazur.eu/) (Nice, France), focused on optimal resource allocation in bacterial growth. In 2022, I started working as a postdoctoral researcher at INRAE Occitanie-Montpellier (Montpellier, France) where, a year after, I obtained a permanent research position in the [MISTEA](https://eng-mistea.montpellier.hub.inrae.fr/description) unit of the [MathNum](https://www.inrae.fr/en) division.
